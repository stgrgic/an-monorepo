## How to choose the best background music for documentaries
Music can be crucial for setting the scene and creating emotional beats in a documentary. Our top tips for choosing your music are:

Is the scene you’re scoring one of high drama or tension? Or is it a quieter moment? Your music search will be simpler if you’ve identified the pace and genre you’re looking for from the start
However, bear in mind that if you’ve chosen something very dramatic, it still needs to be subtle enough not to overly distract the viewer from your scene’s dialogue or messages
What budget do you have? Don’t get hung up on using a commercial track that you can’t afford (or can’t get the rights to), if you can find something that’s very similar from a music library – Audio Network has a wide variety of documentary background music
Library music for documentaries
A music library gives you far greater options in terms of unique tracks, edits and quality. Libraries have different licensing agreements and price points available, depending on what projects you’re using the music for. Audio Network’s search tools enable you to filter based on musical style, mood or emotion, instrumentation, genres such as action, comedy and docudrama and even by bpm. We also hand-pick playlists every month from our 175,000+-track catalogue to help you to find the documentary music you need, whether it’s for a wildlife documentary, or a documentary about the history of war.

## Want some inspiration? Here are some of our most versatile documentary tracks:


Documentary genres
Whether it’s a documentary short, or a nine-and-a-half-hour epic, a biography of a much-loved artist, or an attempt to change the world and how we interact with it, here’s our pick of the best music, historical and political documentaries.

The Best Music Documentaries
Amy (2015)
Director Asif Kapadia takes a fascinating approach to the life and tragic death of Amy Winehouse. Having previously made the acclaimed ‘Senna’, based on F1 legend Ayrton Senna, Kapadia said his film, ‘tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius.’

Using home movies, notebooks and live sessions, together with unheard tracks and a blend of unseen and archive footage, Kapadia conducted more than 100 interviews with Winehouse’s friends and family to provide a narrative around her life and show a side of her the public never got to know – it’s by turns funny and heartbreaking. The film won an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, together with the BAFTA for Best Documentary.

Music has had an evolving and intimate relationship with film ever since the days of live music accompanying the first public projections of the Lumière brothers in the 1890s in Paris. Music was recognised as an essential tool to create atmosphere and give the audience emotional cues.

Perfecting the art of using the right music for film – whether you’re using stock music or a specially-composed score - requires knowledge of how music can direct an audience, and the effects you are trying to achieve within a scene, or across the whole film, whether it’s for drama or horror, sci-fi or something sexy.

What is a film score?
Also sometimes called background music, film soundtrack or incidental music, a film score is original music written specifically to accompany a film. A number of orchestral, instrumental or choral pieces, known as cues, are timed to begin and end at specific points to enhance the scene’s drama and emotional impact.

Music for filmmakers
Free Music for film
Despite the plethora of music you can download for free on Spotify, you can’t just put any music into your production – you can find yourself in hot water, legally. So, your options are to hire a composer or musician, or find music that you can license. Yes, there are plenty of royalty-free sites available, but your project is unique and your music should be too.

### Looking for inspiration? Listen to our top picks:
Mars, Bringer Of War by David Tobin, Jeff Meegan, Julian Gallant, Rob Kelly

### How to license music for film
If you don’t want to commission a composer, there are numerous music libraries for film and TV, which are a great source of music for filmmakers. Audio Network has a catalogue of over 175,000 tracks, created by big-name composers and bright new talent and recorded in some of the world’s best studios – including Abbey Road. We also have a team of music specialists on hand to advise you.

Crafted with media in mind, and organised by genre, every track has a variety of cut-downs and mixes, making it easy to find exactly the right piece, at the right length.

And, with simple, clear licensing, clearing the rights to use them couldn’t be simpler.

So, whether you're making a crime documentary or a sports film, the score for your movie is just waiting to be discovered.

#### The Best Movie Soundtracks
If you’re looking for library or stock music for films, then why not get inspiration from some of cinema’s classics? We’ve picked our favourites below – and suggested some playlists from our catalogue to make choosing the ideal track for your project even easier. 

# Star Wars
If you need any confirmation that music can be key to creating the emotion, atmosphere and pace of a scene, then look no further than these two clips of the ‘Royal Award Ceremony’ from Star Wars Episode IV. Without the iconic John Williams score, the scene is weirdly flat (other than Chewbacca’s original – pretty unnerving - shriek and R2D2’s clanking happy dance), as there’s no dialogue to lift it. The score is crucial in producing an atmosphere of triumphant celebration.
